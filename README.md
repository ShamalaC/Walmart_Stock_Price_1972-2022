# Walmart_Stock_Price_1972-2022
Repository for Walmart Stock Price Analysis and Prediction (1972-2022) using Machine Learning

In this project, we will perform an extensive analysis of Walmart's stock prices from 1972 to 2022 and build a machine learning model to predict future stock prices. This project will help you understand the process of data collection, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and evaluation in a time-series forecasting context.
