    "# Step 1:\n",
    "## The Problem\n",
    "The task is to implement a modified heap where each node can have 2^x children instead of the usual 2 children in a binary heap. To implement two operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Insert: Add a new element to the heap while maintaining the heap property.\n",
    "2. Pop Max: Remove and return the maximum element from the heap while maintaining the heap property.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 2:\n",
    "## Defining the Heap Structure\n",
    "A heap is usually implemented as an array (or list in Python). The key property of a heap is that each parent node is greater than or equal to its children (in a max-heap).\n",
    "\n",
    "In a 2^x-ary heap:\n",
    "\n",
    "Each node has 2^x children.\n",
    "The heap is still a complete tree, meaning all levels are fully filled except possibly the last level, which is filled from left to right.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 3:\n",
    "## Calculate Parent and Child Indices\n",
    "To maintain the heap structure, calculate the parent and child indices in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Parent Index Calculation:\n",
    "\n",
    "For a node at index i, its parent is located at:\n",
    "### parent (𝑖) = 𝑖 − 1 / 2^𝑥\n",
    "This formula ensures that each parent has 2^x children.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Child Indices Calculation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The children of a node at index i start at:\n",
    "### first_child (𝑖) = 2^𝑥 * i+1\n",
    "\n",
    "The children of this node are located from first_child(i) to first_child(i) + 2^x - 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 4: \n",
    "## Implement the Insert Operation\n",
    "The insert operation involves the following steps:\n",
    "1. Append the new element at the end of the heap (i.e., add it to the last position in the list).\n",
    "2. Bubble up the new element to restore the heap property:\n",
    "3. Compare the new element with its parent.\n",
    "4. If the new element is greater than its parent, swap them.\n",
    "5. Continue this process until the element is in the correct position, or it becomes the root (i.e., no more parents to compare).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 5: \n",
    "### Implement the Pop Max Operation\n",
    "The pop max operation involves the following steps:\n",
    "1. Remove the root element (which is the maximum element in a max-heap).\n",
    "2. Replace the root with the last element in the heap.\n",
    "3. Bubble down the new root element to restore the heap property:\n",
    "4. Compare the new root with its children.\n",
    "5. Swap the root with the largest child if the child is greater.\n",
    "6. Continue this process until the element is in the correct position, or it has no children that are larger.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 6:\n",
    "### Analyze the Complexity\n",
    "# Time Complexity:\n",
    "Insert: 𝑂(log𝑛/𝑥)\n",
    "Pop Max: 𝑂(log𝑛/𝑥)\n",
    "\n",
    "The time complexity is minimized by choosing a large x, which reduces the height of the heap.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Space Complexity: \n",
    "𝑂 (𝑛), where n is the number of elements in the heap. The list used to store the heap elements takes linear space."
